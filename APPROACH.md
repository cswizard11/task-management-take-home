# Implementation Approach

## Overview

This document outlines the approach for implementing the Secure Task Management System within the 8-hour time constraint.

## Architecture Strategy

### Monorepo Structure

```
apps/
  api/          ‚Üí NestJS backend with TypeORM + SQLite
  dashboard/    ‚Üí Angular frontend with TailwindCSS
libs/
  data/         ‚Üí Shared TypeScript interfaces & DTOs
  auth/         ‚Üí Reusable RBAC decorators and guards
```

### Technology Stack

- **Backend:** NestJS + TypeORM + SQLite + JWT
- **Frontend:** Angular + TailwindCSS + RxJS
- **Testing:** Jest
- **Monorepo:** NX Workspace

## Role-Based Access Control

### Admin Role (Highest Privilege)

Full administrative control across the entire organization hierarchy.

**Permissions:**

- ‚úÖ Create tasks in their org and all descendant orgs
- ‚úÖ View tasks in their org and all descendant orgs
- ‚úÖ Edit any task in their org and all descendant orgs
- ‚úÖ Delete any task in their org and all descendant orgs
- ‚úÖ Access audit logs for their org and all descendant orgs
- ‚úÖ Full read/write access to entire subtree

**Use Case:** System administrators, department heads who need full control over their domain and all sub-organizations.

### Owner Role (Medium Privilege)

Full control of their own organization, read-only access to child organizations.

**Permissions:**

- ‚úÖ Create tasks in their own org only
- ‚úÖ View tasks in their org and all descendant orgs (read-only for children)
- ‚úÖ Edit tasks in their own org only
- ‚úÖ Delete tasks in their own org only
- ‚úÖ Access audit logs for their org and all descendant orgs (read-only)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Read-only access to child organization tasks

**Use Case:** Team leads, managers who need visibility into their team and sub-teams but should not interfere with child org operations.

### Viewer Role (Lowest Privilege)

Read-only access to their organization.

**Permissions:**

- ‚ùå Cannot create tasks
- ‚úÖ View tasks in their own org only
- ‚ùå Cannot edit tasks
- ‚ùå Cannot delete tasks
- ‚ùå Cannot access audit logs
- üìñ Strictly read-only

**Use Case:** Stakeholders, observers, contractors who need visibility but no modification rights.

## Permission System & Role Inheritance

### Permission Model

Permissions are implemented as predefined constants mapped to roles, demonstrating role inheritance without requiring a database table. Each role inherits all permissions from roles below it in the hierarchy:

**Hierarchy:** `Viewer ‚Üí Owner ‚Üí Admin`

- **Viewer** has base read permissions
- **Owner** inherits all Viewer permissions + adds write permissions for own org
- **Admin** inherits all Owner permissions + extends write permissions to child orgs

### Permission Definitions

Permissions are granular and scope-aware:

- `task:read:own` - View tasks in own organization
- `task:read:children` - View tasks in child organizations
- `task:create:own` - Create tasks in own organization
- `task:create:children` - Create tasks in child organizations
- `task:update:own` - Edit tasks in own organization
- `task:update:children` - Edit tasks in child organizations
- `task:delete:own` - Delete tasks in own organization
- `task:delete:children` - Delete tasks in child organizations
- `audit:read` - Access audit logs

### Role-Permission Mapping

- **Viewer:** `task:read:own`
- **Owner:** All Viewer permissions + `task:create:own`, `task:update:own`, `task:delete:own`, `task:read:children`, `audit:read`
- **Admin:** All Owner permissions + `task:create:children`, `task:update:children`, `task:delete:children`

This inheritance model makes it easy to add new roles or extend permissions in the future by converting to a Permission entity with database-backed role-permission relationships.

## Permission Matrix

| Action                   | Admin | Owner          | Viewer |
| ------------------------ | ----- | -------------- | ------ |
| Create task in own org   | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ             | ‚ùå     |
| Create task in child org | ‚úÖ    | ‚ùå             | ‚ùå     |
| View tasks in own org    | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ     |
| View tasks in child orgs | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ (read-only) | ‚ùå     |
| Edit task in own org     | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ             | ‚ùå     |
| Edit task in child org   | ‚úÖ    | ‚ùå             | ‚ùå     |
| Delete task in own org   | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ             | ‚ùå     |
| Delete task in child org | ‚úÖ    | ‚ùå             | ‚ùå     |
| Access audit logs        | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ (read-only) | ‚ùå     |

## Organization Hierarchy

### N-Level Hierarchy Structure

Organizations support unlimited nesting depth with parent-child relationships.

**Example:**

```
Acme Corporation (Root)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Engineering
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Frontend Team
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Backend Team
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sales
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Enterprise Sales
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SMB Sales
```

### Hierarchy Access Rules

**Admin at Acme Corporation:**

- Full control over all 7 organizations
- Can create/edit/delete tasks anywhere in the tree

**Owner at Engineering:**

- Full control over Engineering tasks
- Read-only access to Frontend Team and Backend Team tasks
- Cannot modify Frontend or Backend tasks

**Admin at Frontend Team:**

- Full control over Frontend Team tasks only
- Cannot see Engineering, Backend, Acme, or Sales tasks

**Viewer at Sales:**

- Can only view Sales tasks
- Cannot see Enterprise or SMB child org tasks

## Data Model

### Organization

- Self-referencing hierarchy (parentId references Organization.id)
- Supports unlimited nesting depth
- Each organization belongs to zero or one parent
- Each organization can have multiple children

### User

- Belongs to exactly one organization
- Has exactly one role (Admin, Owner, or Viewer)
- Role applies within their organization context

### Task

- Belongs to exactly one organization
- Created by one user (owner)
- Visibility and modification rights determined by user role and org hierarchy

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation (2 hours)

**Priority: CRITICAL**

1. **Database Setup**

   - ‚úÖ Configure TypeORM with SQLite
   - ‚úÖ Create entities: User, Organization, Task
   - ‚úÖ Implement N-level organization hierarchy (self-referencing)
   - ‚úÖ Set up entity relationships

2. **Authentication**

   - ‚úÖ JWT strategy implementation
   - ‚úÖ Login endpoint with email/password
   - ‚úÖ JWT guard for protected routes
   - ‚úÖ Password hashing with bcrypt

3. **Seed Data**
   - Create sample organization hierarchy
   - Create test users with different roles
   - Create sample tasks for testing

### Phase 2: RBAC & Hierarchical Access (2 hours)

**Priority: CRITICAL**

1. **Organization Hierarchy Service**

   - Method to get all descendant organizations
   - Method to get accessible organization IDs based on user role
   - Permission checking helpers

2. **Access Control Guards**

   - Custom role-based guards
   - Decorators for permission checking
   - Organization hierarchy-aware access scoping
   - Different logic for Admin vs Owner vs Viewer

3. **Task API Endpoints**

   - `POST /tasks` - Create task (Admin/Owner in own org, Admin in child orgs)
   - `GET /tasks` - List accessible tasks (scoped by role and org hierarchy)
   - `PUT /tasks/:id` - Update task (Admin/Owner in own org, Admin in child orgs)
   - `DELETE /tasks/:id` - Delete task (Admin/Owner in own org, Admin in child orgs)
   - `GET /audit-log` - View access logs (Admin/Owner only)

4. **Audit Logging**
   - Console logging for create/update/delete operations
   - Log user, action, timestamp, and affected resource

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation (2.5 hours)

**Priority: HIGH**

1. **Authentication UI**

   - Login page with email/password form
   - Form validation
   - JWT storage in localStorage
   - HTTP interceptor to attach JWT to all requests
   - Auto-redirect to login on 401

2. **Task Dashboard**

   - Task list component showing accessible tasks
   - Display organization name for each task
   - Conditional UI based on user role
   - Create task form (hidden for Viewers, scoped for Owners)
   - Edit task button (only for tasks user can modify)
   - Delete task button (only for tasks user can delete)
   - Responsive layout with TailwindCSS

3. **State Management**
   - Angular services for task management
   - RxJS observables for reactive updates
   - Current user state management

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish (1 hour)

**Priority: MEDIUM**

1. **Backend Tests**

   - JWT authentication flow
   - Role-based permission guards
   - Hierarchy access logic (Admin full access, Owner read-only children, Viewer own org only)
   - Task CRUD operations with permission checks
   - Edge cases (access denied, invalid tokens, etc.)

2. **Code Quality**
   - Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
   - Input validation with DTOs
   - Security best practices (no password exposure, SQL injection prevention)

### Phase 5: Documentation (0.5 hours)

**Priority: CRITICAL**

1. **README Updates**
   - Clear setup instructions (dependencies, environment, database)
   - Architecture overview with organization hierarchy explanation
   - Role definitions with examples
   - API documentation with sample requests/responses
   - Data model diagram showing relationships
   - Access control explanation with real-world scenarios

## Success Criteria

### Must Have

‚úÖ Real JWT authentication (no mock)  
‚úÖ Three distinct roles with different permission levels  
‚úÖ N-level organization hierarchy with self-referencing structure  
‚úÖ Admin: full access to own org + all descendants  
‚úÖ Owner: full access to own org, read-only to descendants  
‚úÖ Viewer: read-only access to own org only  
‚úÖ All 4 task CRUD endpoints functional  
‚úÖ Hierarchical task visibility based on role  
‚úÖ Login UI with token management  
‚úÖ Task management dashboard with role-based UI  
‚úÖ Basic test coverage (auth, RBAC, hierarchy)  
‚úÖ Complete README documentation

### Nice to Have (if time permits)

- Task sorting and filtering
- Task categorization (Work, Personal, etc.)
- Drag-and-drop for reordering
- Visual task completion charts
- Organization tree visualization
- Dark mode toggle
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Comprehensive test suite

## Technical Decisions

### Why N-Level Hierarchy Instead of 2-Level?

- Implementation complexity is identical (self-referencing relationship)
- Provides more flexibility and real-world applicability
- Demonstrates understanding of recursive data structures
- Better showcase of technical skills

### Why These Role Definitions?

- **Admin:** System-level control for IT staff, executive leadership
- **Owner:** Middle management with oversight but not interference
- **Viewer:** Stakeholders, clients, read-only observers
- Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- Real-world applicability

### Why SQLite?

- Zero configuration required
- Portable (single file database)
- Sufficient for development and demonstration
- Easy to inspect and debug
- Can be replaced with PostgreSQL for production

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Time Management**

   - Strict phase time limits with buffer
   - Hierarchy logic is critical - implement and test early
   - Skip optional UI features if behind schedule
   - Focus on working code over perfect code

2. **Technical Risks**

   - Test hierarchy access logic early to catch issues
   - Use NestJS/Angular CLI generators for boilerplate
   - Reference official documentation when stuck
   - Seed database with realistic data for testing

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Manual testing throughout development
   - Focus tests on critical paths (auth, RBAC, hierarchy)
   - Ensure proper error messages and HTTP status codes

## Future Enhancements

These items demonstrate forward thinking and can be discussed in interviews:

- **Security:** JWT refresh tokens, CSRF protection, rate limiting, helmet.js
- **Performance:** Redis caching for hierarchy queries, materialized paths for faster lookups
- **Features:** Role delegation, temporary permissions, task assignments, notifications
- **Scalability:** PostgreSQL with connection pooling, horizontal scaling, CDN for frontend
- **Observability:** Structured logging (Winston), error tracking (Sentry), metrics (Prometheus)
- **Advanced Hierarchy:** Organization transfer, restructuring, soft deletes
- **Audit:** Database-persisted audit trail with full history, compliance reporting
